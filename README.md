1. What is Logging:
is the process of recording events that occur within a system.
These events can be anything from errors and warnings to informational messages and detailed debug information. The recorded events are typically stored in a log file for later analysis.

2. Why Logging is importance:
   -Error detection and debugging: By examining log files, developers can identify
   the root cause of issues and fix them efficiently.
   -Performance monitoring: Log data can be analyzed to track system performance and identify bottlenecks.
   -Security auditing: Logs can record user actions, system events, and security-related incidents, aiding in security investigations and compliance.
   -System monitoring: Logging helps track system behavior and detect anomalies
   
3. understanding Logging Levels:
   Logging levels are used to categorize the importance of log messages.
    They help filter out less important messages and focus on the most critical information. Common logging levels include:
   
   -Debug: Detailed information for developers, usually disabled in production environments.
   -Info: General informational messages about the system's operation.Â  
   -Warning: Potential issues that might arise in the future.
   -Error: Indicates that something unexpected happened, but the system can continue to operate.
   -Fatal: Indicates a serious error that prevents the system from continuing.
